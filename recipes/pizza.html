        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Pizza Dough:</strong></li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Stir the mixture until it forms a dough, then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong>Prepare the Pizza Sauce:</strong></li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>In a saucepan, heat a bit of olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. Remove it from heat.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong></li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong>Assemble and Bake the Pizza:</strong></li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface into your desired pizza shape and thickness</li>
                <li>If using a pizza stone, transfer the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper. Otherwise, place it on a lightly greased pizza pan or baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Spread a generous layer of the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add your favorite toppings. Get creative!</li>
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong></li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated stone in the oven. Otherwise, place the pan or baking sheet with the pizza directly in the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve your homemade pizza, and enjoy the deliciousness!</li>
